# Dice-Game

June - 2022
A basic web dice game that uses JS to change the dice face displayed and show the winner.

The page  utilizes two random number generator functions to select the value of the dice and use that value to select the image to display on the refresh of the page. 

It then is able to display who the winner is at the top depending on the outcome.

This is the first page I made that utilized JS.
